        <p>We present a curated database of the best campsites in the vast woods and
            backcountry of the World Wide Web Wilderness. We increase access to adventure
            for the public while promoting safe and respectful use of resources. The expert
            wilderness trekkers on our staff personally verify each campsite to make sure
            that they are up to our standards. We also present a platform for campers to
            share reviews on campsites they have visited with each other.</p>
